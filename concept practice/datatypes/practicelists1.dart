Prompt the user to enter tasks and add them to the list.
Allow the user to add multiple tasks, one at a time.

- View Tasks:

Show the total number of tasks.

- Remove a Task:
Allow the user to remove a task by specifying its position or name.
If the task isnâ€™t found, inform the user.

- Check for Specific Tasks:
Allow the user to check if a specific task is in the list.

- Exit Option:
Provide an option to exit the program.

Example Flow:

- Start Program:
Initialize an empty list.
Display a menu with options to add, view, remove tasks, or exit.

- User Interaction:
User chooses to add tasks.
User enters tasks one by one.
The program displays the list of tasks.
The user can remove tasks or check if a task is in the list.
The user can exit the program.
Final Output:
