/* Description: Create a simple text analyzer program that performs various operations on a given string input by the user. 
The program should include the following features:

- User Input:
Prompt the user to enter a sentence or phrase. Store this input in a string variable.

- Character Search:
Ask the user to input a character they want to search for within the sentence.
Implement a function to check if this character exists in the string.
Print a message indicating whether the character was found or not.

- String Length:
Calculate the length of the string entered by the user.
Print the length of the string.

- Case Conversion:
Implement two functions: one that converts the string to uppercase and another that converts it to lowercase.
Display the results of both conversions.

- String Interpolation:
Create a new sentence using string interpolation that includes the original string and additional information like its length and the character searched for.
Print the new sentence.

- String Concatenation:
Take two or more different string variables (e.g., first part, middle part, last part) and concatenate them into one complete sentence.
Print the final concatenated string.

- Final Output:
Display all the results in a formatted output, showing the original string, the results of the character search, 
the length of the string, 
the uppercase and lowercase versions, the interpolated sentence, and the concatenated string.

- Additional Challenge:
Implement basic error handling. For example, if the user inputs a number instead of a character for the search, 
provide a warning message and prompt them to try again. */


void main () {

  String enterSentence = "brrr"; // User must enter a sentence.
    print("$enterSentence");
