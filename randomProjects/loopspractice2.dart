/* 

Loop Challenge: Counting and Summing Numbers
Write a program that:

For Loop:
Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 5.

For-in Loop:
Create a list of numbers [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] and use a for-in loop to print each number.

While Loop:
Use a while loop to keep adding 5 to a starting value of 0, stopping when the value is greater than or equal to 25. Print the value after each addition.

Do-While Loop:
Use a do-while loop to subtract 2 from 10, and stop when the value becomes less than or equal to 0. Print the value after each subtraction.

 */

void main(){
// Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 5.

int num = 3;

    for(num; num <= 5; num++) {


  print("added 1 to $num");
}

// Create a list of numbers [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] and use a for-in loop to print each number.

List numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

for (var i in numbers ) {
  print(i * 2);
}

// Use a while loop to keep adding 5 to a starting value of 0, stopping when the value is greater than or equal to 25. 
//Print the value after each addition.
